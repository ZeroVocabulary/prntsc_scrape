6 character combination of letters and numbers

36^6 = ‭2,176,782,336‬ potential images

From our 100 image sample, 67 were valid, so there are probably:
2,176,782,336 * 0.67 = 1,458,444,165 actual images

Our 67 images from our 100 image sample were 13 MB total, so:
13 / 67 = 0.194 MB average image size

This means that the actual images have a size of around:
1,458,444,165 * 0.194 = 282,938,168 MB ~= 283 TB

I have no chance of downloading all of these or getting anywhere close.
I think I will continue to randomly generate images

It seems like the images are uploaded in order?
I uploaded and got ql4ak5.
When I changed the first letter to r,s,t,u,etc. I got nothing.
When I changed the first letter to p,o,s etc (letters before q) i got images
I just tested with the program, all codes r and above are invalid.

So I probably can change my first character to be random from 0 to q,
and waste less time.
I changed it and now I got 96/100 images instead of 67/100 images.
I get this error still:
Error: The "url" argument must be of type string. Received type undefined
I don't know whats causing it but it doesn't seem to matter.
I got 4 invalid urls, which accounts for the 4 missing from 96/100.
I also got 4 of those undefined errors but there's no missing images for those.
I have some broken images that start with 0,
and I noticed those ones just take you to the homepage,
so I will skip those as well, and not do any ids starting with 0.

This also allows us to estimate dates, potentially extremely well.
They probably get many images uploaded per minute, and some will have dates,
so we can probably get dates down to the day/hour or even minute.
